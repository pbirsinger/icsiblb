\section{Comparison to Naive Python}

In this section we will briefly compare the performance of the generated code to that of naive Python, indicating why it makes sense to use this specializer by seeing just how much speedup can be gained 

--table comparing times between distributed code and python for a few example runnings of blb  

probably would be good to compare python times for when passing in scores, 
and a python time for a very small running where scores are calculated in estimator function
