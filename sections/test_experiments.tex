\section{Experiments Varying Test Set Size}

We vary the number of test positives for each event in test set, arbitrarily halving the number of positives each time (number of positives range from 15 to 234). 
A high standard deviation from BLB on a test set indicates that the result on this test set may not be significant, and that it could sway largely on similar test sets. 
Contrarily, a low standard deviation from BLB indicates that the classification accuracy on similar test sets will likely be comparable, and even that the size of the test set may be reduced. 



--Will soon show here graph of actual EER on each of the test sets (full, 1/2 positives, 1/4 positives, 1/8 positives) for each of the 20 events

--Will soon show here graph of standard deviations of EER estimated on each of the test sets for each of the 20 events

discussion of at what points test set is too big/small from results ..
