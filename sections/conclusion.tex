\section{Conclusion}

Our proposed methodology makes accessible to multimedia classification domain experts coding in Python what was never accessible before: an efficient means to estimate multimedia classifier performance via bootstrapping. 
After specifying in Python the measure of the classifier performance, such as EER, or a misdetection rate for a given false alarm rate, the domain expert enjoys scalable performance without the stresses of implementing scalable performance. 
The ability to rapidly express efficient bootstrapping applications simplifies pinpointing ideal test and training set sizes with the goal of maximizing accuracy while minimizing comptuation time, as shown by our experiments. 
This methodology can be extended using the SEJITS approach to allow other taxing multimedia analysis computations to be approached from productivity level languages such as Python.
