\section{Conclusion}

Our proposed methodology makes accessible to multimedia classification researchers coding in Python what was never accessible before: an efficient means to estimate video detection system performance via bootstrapping.
This newfound accessibility to efficiency becomes critical on increasingly large consumer-produced multimedia datasets, as we demonstrate. 
With the aid of this methodology, the construction of video detection systems will be made easier.
