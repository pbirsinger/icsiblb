\section{Experiments Varying Training Set Size}

We vary the number of training positives for each event, decreasing by 10 each time from roughly 100 positives to 10 positives. 

--Will soon show here graph of actual EER on training sets from each of the 10 models built for each of the 20 events 

--Will soon show here graph of standard deviations of EER estimated on test set from training set of blb for each of the 20 events

--Will soon show here graph of actual EER on test set from each of the 10 models built for each of the 20 events 

will locate point at which estimated standard deviation from BLB becomes so large, or performance becomes so poor, that cannot reduce training set further

this is minimal necessary training set size of consumer produced videos from this set for our classification performance requirements (to be defined).

data here can probably help to support: \cite{elizalde2012there}
